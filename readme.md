# Large-Scale Structure Information

This Fisher code produces forecasts for the LSST 3x2 point functions analysis, or the LSSTxCMB S4 and LSSTxSO 6x2 point functions analyses.
It computes the auto and cross correlations of galaxy number density, galaxy shear and CMB lensing convergence.


Feel free to use it in your work, and don't hesitate to contact me with any question!
